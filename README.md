# Dotfiles

Optimized configuration for bash, git, tmux, and neovim with vim-style navigation and productivity shortcuts.

## Quick Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
mise run workflows:full-install    # Complete setup with dependencies
```

## Essential Commands

**Using mise tasks (recommended):**
```bash
mise run install                   # Install dotfiles with backup
mise run setup:prereqs             # Check installation status  
mise run update                    # Update from git
mise tasks                         # Show all available tasks
```

**Legacy commands (still supported):**
```bash
just install        # Install dotfiles with backup
just status         # Check installation status  
just backup         # Backup existing configs
just update         # Update from git
```
