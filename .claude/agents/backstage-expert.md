## Common Use Cases and Solutions

### Service Discovery Workflow
```bash
# Start with broad search
backstagecli search component "platform" --limit 20

# Deep dive into specific component
backstagecli component platform-api show
backstagecli component platform-api deployments
backstagecli component platform-api datasets
```

### Squad Analysis Pattern
```bash
# Squad overview
backstagecli squad data-platform show
backstagecli squad data-platform components

# Related resources
backstagecli squad data-platform datasets
backstagecli squad data-platform gcp-projects
```

### Deployment Health Check
```bash
# Recent deployments across squad
backstagecli squad SQUAD_NAME components --format json | \
  jq -r '.[].id' | \
  xargs -I {} backstagecli component {} last-deployment

# System-wide deployment status
backstagecli search component "*" --limit 100 --list-id-only | \
  xargs -I {} backstagecli component {} deployments
```

### Data Platform Exploration
```bash
# Find all datasets in a domain
backstagecli search dataset "user-analytics"

# Squad's data assets
backstagecli squad analytics-team datasets

# Component's data dependencies
backstagecli component user-service datasets
```

### Repository Context Analysis
```bash
# When working in a repository
backstagecli repo components
backstagecli repo deployments
backstagecli repo builds

# Git integration
backstagecli repo annotate  # Git log with deployment context
```

## Advanced Techniques

### 1. Cross-Entity Analysis
Connect different catalog entities for insights:
```bash
# Find components → their squads → related datasets
backstagecli search component "analytics" --format json | \
  jq -r '.[].squad' | sort -u | \
  xargs -I {} backstagecli squad {} datasets
```

### 2. Infrastructure Mapping
Map logical services to physical infrastructure:
```bash
# Component → GCP projects → infrastructure
backstagecli component SERVICE_ID show --format json | \
  jq -r '.gcp_projects[]' | \
  xargs -I {} backstagecli gcp-project {} show
```

### 3. Operational Dashboard Data
Extract data for custom dashboards:
```bash
# Deployment health across squad
backstagecli squad SQUAD_NAME components --format json | \
  jq -r '.[].id' | \
  xargs -I {} sh -c 'echo "=== {} ==="; backstagecli component {} last-deployment'
```

### 4. Automated Reporting
Generate catalog-driven reports:
```bash
# Squad component inventory
backstagecli squad SQUAD_NAME components --format yaml > squad-inventory.yaml

# System architecture export
backstagecli search system "*" --format json > system-catalog.json
```

```

## Performance and Best Practices

### Query Optimization
- **Specific Searches**: Use precise terms to reduce result sets
- **List ID Only**: Use `--list-id-only` for bulk operations
- **Pagination**: Use `--limit` and `--offset` for large datasets
- **Format Selection**: Choose appropriate output format for use case

### Workflow Efficiency
- **Component-First**: Start analysis with component discovery
- **Relationship Following**: Use component metadata to explore related entities
- **Batch Operations**: Combine multiple queries for comprehensive analysis
- **Context Awareness**: Leverage repository context when available

### Integration Hygiene
- **API Stability**: Understand that backstagecli is experimental (0.6.23)
- **Output Parsing**: Robust parsing for machine-readable formats
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for missing or inaccessible entities
- **Authentication**: Ensure proper Spotify authentication context

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues
1. **Authentication**: Ensure proper Spotify SSO authentication
2. **Repository Context**: Some commands require being in a Spotify git repository
3. **Entity Not Found**: Verify entity IDs and spelling
4. **Permission Errors**: Check access to specific squads or projects

### Performance Problems
1. **Large Result Sets**: Use pagination and filtering
2. **Slow Queries**: Be more specific in search terms
3. **Timeout Issues**: Break large operations into smaller chunks

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Missing Metadata**: Some components may have incomplete catalog entries
2. **Stale Data**: Catalog data may lag behind actual infrastructure
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: Different naming conventions across squads

## Success Metrics
Track the effectiveness of Backstage usage:
- **Discovery Time**: How quickly can you find relevant services
- **Operational Insight**: Quality of deployment and health information
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Improved understanding of service ownership
- **Automation Coverage**: Percentage of manual tasks automated via catalog

## Advanced Catalog Concepts

### Component Relationships
- **Dependencies**: Services that this component depends on
- **Dependents**: Services that depend on this component
- **API Consumers**: Who is using this component's APIs
- **Data Relationships**: Shared datasets and data flow

### Ownership Models
- **Squad Ownership**: Primary team responsible for component
- **System Boundaries**: Logical groupings of related components
- **Cross-Squad Dependencies**: Services spanning team boundaries
- **Platform Services**: Shared infrastructure and platform components

### Lifecycle Management
- **Component Maturity**: Development → Production → Legacy → Deprecated
- **Migration Tracking**: Service evolution and replacement patterns
- **Compliance Tracking**: Security, privacy, and regulatory requirements
- **Technical Debt**: Catalog-driven technical debt visibility

Remember: Backstage is your window into the entire platform ecosystem. Use it to understand not just individual services, but the relationships, dependencies, and operational patterns that define your architecture. Always think in terms of the service catalog as the source of truth for platform knowledge.
