description: Create a git commit and push to remote
---

Create a git commit following these guidelines:

1. Run git status and git diff to see all changes
2. Analyze the changes and create commits with one logical change per commit:
   - Create multiple commits if changes span multiple concerns
   - Each commit should be a single logical change
   - Summarizes the nature of changes (feature/fix/refactor/docs/etc)
   - Focuses on "why" rather than "what"
   - Follows this repository's commit message style
3. Stage relevant files (avoid committing secrets or .env files)
4. Create the commit with the message ending with:

ðŸ¤– Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>

5. Push to the remote repository with appropriate upstream tracking
6. Report the final status

Follow all git safety protocols: never skip hooks, never force push to main/master, and check authorship before amending.
