## Query Syntax

### Basic Text Search
```bash
# Simple text search
codesearch "function_name"

# Case-insensitive search
codesearch "Function_Name" case:no

# Regular expression search
codesearch "func.*name"
codesearch "^class.*Controller$"
```

### Filters

#### Path and File Filters
- `file:{path_pattern}` or `f:{path_pattern}` - Filter by file path pattern
  ```bash
  codesearch "TODO" file:src/
  codesearch "import" f:*.py
  ```

- `path:{path_pattern}` - Filter by full path pattern
  ```bash
  codesearch "config" path:backend/services/
  ```

#### Language Filter
- `lang:{language}` or `l:{language}` - Filter by programming language
  ```bash
  codesearch "useState" lang:javascript
  codesearch "async def" l:python
  ```

#### Repository Filter
- `repo:{repo_pattern}` or `r:{repo_pattern}` - Filter by repository name
  ```bash
  codesearch "API_KEY" repo:backend-*
  codesearch "database" r:service-api
  ```

#### Case Sensitivity
- `case:yes` or `case:no` - Control case sensitivity (default: yes)
  ```bash
  codesearch "className" case:no
  ```

#### Component Filters (for organized codebases)
- `componenttype:{type}` or `ct:{type}` - Filter by component type
  ```bash
  codesearch "auth" componenttype:mobile-api
  codesearch "login" ct:web-service
  ```

- `lifecycle:{phase}` - Filter by component lifecycle phase
  ```bash
  codesearch "deprecated" lifecycle:experimental
  codesearch "TODO" lifecycle:production
  ```

### Boolean Logic and Predicates

#### AND Operation (Space-separated)
```bash
# Files containing both "async" AND "await"
codesearch "async await"

# Files with "config" in Python files
codesearch "config" lang:python
```

#### OR Operation
```bash
# Files containing either "TODO" OR "FIXME"
codesearch "TODO or FIXME"

# JavaScript or TypeScript files
codesearch "import" "lang:javascript or lang:typescript"
```

#### Negation (Exclusion)
```bash
# Find "password" but not in test files
codesearch "password" -file:test

# Find "console.log" but not in node_modules
codesearch "console.log" -path:node_modules/
```

#### Parentheses for Complex Queries
```bash
# Complex boolean logic
codesearch "(TODO or FIXME) and priority" lang:python

# Multiple conditions
codesearch "(async or await)" "lang:javascript or lang:typescript" -file:test
```

## Regular Expression Support

### Supported Operators
- `^` - Start of line
- `$` - End of line
- `|` - Alternation
- `*` - Zero or more
- `+` - One or more
- `?` - Zero or one
- `[...]` - Character class
- `.` - Any character
- `\s` - Whitespace (spaces and tabs)
- `\n` - Newline (for multi-line matching)

### Important Notes
- Multi-line matching is supported for consecutive lines using `\n`
- Non-consecutive multi-line patterns are NOT supported
- Special characters must be escaped with `\`

### Escape Sequences
When searching for special characters, escape them with `\`:
```bash
# Search for function calls (escape parentheses)
codesearch "main\(\)"

# Search for array access (escape brackets)
codesearch "array\[0\]"

# Search for scope resolution (escape colons)
codesearch "std\:\:string"

# Search for regex patterns (escape special chars)
codesearch "regex\.\*pattern"
```

### Examples
```bash
# Find function definitions
codesearch "^def\s+\w+\("

# Find class definitions ending with "Controller"
codesearch "class.*Controller$"

# Find imports from specific modules
codesearch "^import.*from ['\"](react|vue|angular)"

# Find TODO comments with specific patterns
codesearch "//\s*(TODO|FIXME|HACK):\s*"

# Find variable declarations
codesearch "(const|let|var)\s+\w+\s*="

# Multi-line pattern matching
codesearch "function\s+\w+\(.*\)\s*{\n\s*console\.log"

# Find function with specific whitespace
codesearch "def\s+process\s*\(\s*data\s*\)"
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Security Audits
```bash
# Find potential API keys or secrets
codesearch "(api[_-]?key|secret|token|password)" case:no -file:test

# Find hardcoded credentials
codesearch "password\s*=\s*['\"]" -path:test/

# Find SQL injection vulnerabilities
codesearch "query.*\+.*request\." lang:javascript
```

### 2. Code Quality Checks
```bash
# Find all TODO/FIXME comments
codesearch "(TODO|FIXME|XXX|HACK)" -path:node_modules/

# Find console.log statements (for cleanup)
codesearch "console\.(log|error|warn)" lang:javascript -file:test

# Find commented-out code
codesearch "^[[:space:]]*(//|#|/\*).*function"
```

### 3. Refactoring Support
```bash
# Find all usages of a deprecated function
codesearch "oldFunctionName\(" -file:deprecated

# Find specific import statements
codesearch "import.*OldComponent" lang:javascript

# Find class instantiations
codesearch "new\s+ClassName\("
```

### 4. Architecture Analysis
```bash
# Find all API endpoints
codesearch "@(Get|Post|Put|Delete)Mapping" lang:java

# Find all React components
codesearch "^(function|const).*=.*\(.*\).*=>.*<" lang:javascript

# Find database queries
codesearch "(SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE).*FROM" case:no
```

### 5. Documentation Search
```bash
# Find all markdown documentation
codesearch "^#" file:*.md

# Find JSDoc comments
codesearch "/\*\*" lang:javascript

# Find Python docstrings
codesearch '"""' lang:python
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Multi-Repository Search
```bash
# Search across multiple repositories
codesearch "SharedComponent" repo:frontend-* or repo:mobile-*

# Find cross-repository dependencies
codesearch "import.*@company/shared" repo:*
```

### Component-Based Search (for monorepos)
```bash
# Search only in production components
codesearch "database.connect" lifecycle:production

# Search in specific component types
codesearch "authentication" componenttype:mobile-api lifecycle:production
```

### Performance-Oriented Searches
```bash
# Use specific paths to narrow search scope
codesearch "pattern" path:src/specific/module/

# Combine multiple filters for precision
codesearch "useEffect" lang:javascript file:*.jsx path:src/components/
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Broad, Then Narrow
```bash
# Initial search
codesearch "authentication"

# Refine with filters
codesearch "authentication" lang:python path:backend/

# Further refinement
codesearch "authentication" lang:python path:backend/ -file:test
```

### 2. Use Regular Expressions Wisely
```bash
# Good: Specific pattern
codesearch "^class\s+\w+Controller"

# Avoid: Too broad
codesearch ".*"
```

### 3. Combine Filters Effectively
```bash
# Effective combination
codesearch "TODO" lang:python lifecycle:production -path:tests/

# Overly restrictive (might miss results)
codesearch "TODO" file:exact_file.py line:42
```

### 4. Leverage Component Filters
```bash
# For organized codebases
codesearch "critical_function" componenttype:core-service lifecycle:production
```

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Git Integration
```bash
# Search only in changed files
git diff --name-only | xargs -I {} codesearch "pattern" file:{}

# Search in specific branch
git checkout feature-branch && codesearch "new_feature"
```

### CI/CD Integration
```bash
# Pre-commit hook for code quality
codesearch "console.log" lang:javascript -file:test && echo "Remove console.log statements"

# Security scan
codesearch "(api_key|secret|password).*=.*['\"]" && exit 1
```

### IDE Integration
```bash
# Create search function for shell
cs() {
    codesearch "$@" | head -20
}

# Search and open in editor
codesearch "pattern" | xargs nvim
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No results found**
   - Check case sensitivity: add `case:no`
   - Broaden search: remove restrictive filters
   - Verify path exists: check file/path filters

2. **Too many results**
   - Add language filter: `lang:specific_language`
   - Narrow path: `path:specific/directory/`
   - Exclude test files: `-file:test`

3. **Regex not working**
   - Escape special characters properly
   - Use quotes around complex patterns
   - Test regex separately first

### Performance Tips

1. **Use specific paths**: `path:src/module/` instead of searching entire repo
2. **Combine filters early**: Multiple filters reduce search space
3. **Avoid broad wildcards**: `.*` patterns are expensive
4. **Use language filters**: Significantly reduces search scope

## Command Reference

### Quick Reference
```bash
# Basic search
codesearch "search_term"

# With filters
codesearch "term" lang:python file:*.py path:src/

# Boolean logic
codesearch "term1 or term2" -file:test

# Regular expression
codesearch "^pattern.*end$"

# Case-insensitive
codesearch "Pattern" case:no

# Component search
codesearch "term" componenttype:api lifecycle:production
```
